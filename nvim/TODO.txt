TODOs
=====

- Re-structure lua config
    - Try to move all current config (as-is)
- Consider installing Noice for better error/message viewing
- Find a plugin to show my current keymappings
- CoC Automatically import
- CoC find next error
    - Is there a way to navigate and fix these? Maybe look at a plugin called Trouble?
- CoC rename var/func
- Add a plugin for .EditorConfig ?
- Lightline, fix missing char; is this working LightlineCharcode?
- Upgrade global npm, maybe use nvm, as many of our coc plugins work with this
- Disable notifactions of lazyvim, maybe show something in lightline instead?
