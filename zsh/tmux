# Tmux plugin for zsh:

# Automatically start a tmux session upon logging in. Set to false by default.
ZSH_TMUX_AUTOSTART="false"
# Only attempt to autostart tmux once. If this is disabled when the previous option is enabled, then tmux will be autostarted every time you source your zsh config files. Set to true by default.
ZSH_TMUX_AUTOSTART_ONCE="true"
# When running tmux automatically connect to the currently running tmux session if it exits, otherwise start a new session. Set to true by default.
ZSH_TMUX_AUTOCONNECT="true"
# Close the terminal session when tmux exits. Set to the value of ZSH_TMUX_AUTOSTART by default.
ZSH_TMUX_AUTOQUIT="true"
# When running tmux, the variable $TERM is supposed to be set to screen or one of its derivatives. This option will set the default-terminal option of tmux to screen-256color if 256 color terminal support is detected, and screen otherwise. The term values it uses can be overridden by changing the ZSH_TMUX_FIXTERM_WITH_256COLOR and ZSH_TMUX_FIXTERM_WITHOUT_256COLOR variables respectively. Set to true by default.
ZSH_TMUX_FIXTERM="true"
